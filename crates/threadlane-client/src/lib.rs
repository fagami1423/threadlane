//! Client surface for the Threadlane daemon.
//!
//! [`DaemonClient`] is the only boundary the UI talks to: commands go in as
//! serializable [`SessionCommand`]s, events come out as [`SessionEvent`]s.
//! Two transports implement it:
//!
//! - [`LocalDaemon`] — owns a [`DaemonCore`] in-process. The desktop app's
//!   zero-regression path; identical semantics to the pre-split in-process
//!   services.
//! - [`RemoteDaemon`] — a WebSocket client speaking bare `SessionCommand`
//!   JSON outbound and `SessionEvent` JSON inbound. On every (re)connect the
//!   server replays its bounded journal tail before live events, which is
//!   what makes attach-mid-run work.
//!
//! Framing is one JSON value per WebSocket text message — bare commands
//! outbound (a `CommandRequest` envelope for reply-carrying commands),
//! `{"seq", "event"}` and `{"response"}` frames inbound. The client-facing
//! `subscribe()` receiver collapses every transport into one ordered
//! `SessionEvent` stream so views never learn which side they are on.
