//! Daemon wire contract (issue #79): every type that crosses between the
//! daemon-owned session core and thin clients.
//!
//! Everything in this module is plain data — `Serialize + Deserialize`,
//! ID- or path-referenced, free of process handles — so a client can speak
//! the contract over a channel today (the GPUI app embeds `threadlane-daemon`
//! in-process) or over a socket tomorrow (`threadlane-daemon` the process).
//!
//! Surface map:
//! - [`SessionCommand`]: every request a client can issue. Commands that need
//!   a live session address it by `session_id`; the daemon resolves the
//!   owning runtime internally (handles never cross the wire).
//! - [`SessionEvent`]: the live event stream. `Agent` wraps the shared
//!   [`AgentEvent`] vocabulary (turn lifecycle, message deltas, tool calls,
//!   permission/question requests, subagent and fusion updates); the rest are
//!   daemon-level events for worktree setup, titles, scheduled results, ACP
//!   config options, and session/project deltas.
//! - [`SessionSnapshot`] / [`ProjectInfo`]: attach-mid-run semantics — a
//!   client that connects or selects a session gets one snapshot and then
//!   tails live `SessionEvent`s.
//! - [`CommandRequest`] / [`CommandReply`] / [`CommandResponse`]: the
//!   optional request/reply pair for commands that must return a payload
//!   (e.g. the staged content of a cancelled queued message). Replies are
//!   point-to-point on the requesting connection — never journaled or
//!   broadcast, so a `?since=` replay never resends them.
//!
//! Session files stay `PathBuf`s on the wire: the daemon owns the filesystem
//! and paths are the canonical identity handle. Consumers must not assume
//! the file is readable from their own process; `session_id` is the key.
